# Homework 5 Assignment
## Weather Dashboard

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a weather application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and the openweather API's with the following acceptance criteria:

-GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
-WHEN I search for a city
-THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
-WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
-THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
-WHEN I view the UV index
-THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
-WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
-THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
-WHEN I click on a city in the search history
-THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
-WHEN I open the weather dashboard
-THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast

This assignment was particularly difficult, but through collaboration with Joseph Jepson (@alligatormonday) I was able to build it from the ground up, with no pre-existing code, while maintaining a distinct product and code structure from him. I also used this assignment as an opportunity to utilize an unfamiliar front-end framework (Materialize). Doing so was challenging, since there is much less freedom when following Google's Material Design standards, especially since I am not yet familiar with Sass. In the end, I learned an immense amount from this assignment, and now feel much more comfortable with both jQuery and utilizing API's.

### Credits
- Joseph Jepson (@alligatormonday) for overall collaboration and specifically assistance utilizing string interpolation through template literals.
- Dane Burns (@daneburns) for troubleshooting, and moment API data formatting
- Jeremy Cantwell (tutor) for general guidance, direction, and assistance with correcting a CORS error which popped up mid-assignment

### Websites utilized for general information and reference:
- w3schools
- MDN
- Materialize
- Stack overflow; link in javascript (specifically for a solution to the autocomplete feature, which is still being worked on at this time)
